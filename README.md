## Deployment Infrastructure

This frontend is deployed as a static site using a high-performance AWS architecture:

* **AWS S3:** Hosts the static build files (HTML/CSS/JS).
* **AWS CloudFront:** Distributes content globally via edge locations.
* **GitHub Actions:** Automates deployment on push to `main`:
1. Installs dependencies & builds the project (`npm run build`).
2. Syncs the `dist/` folder to the S3 bucket.
3. Invalidates the CloudFront cache to ensure users see the latest version instantly.

## Connects To

This frontend consumes the following backend services:

* **Authentication:** JWT-based login, registration, and password resets.
* **Task Management:** CRUD operations, filtering, and bulk updates.
* **Real-time Interactions:** Comments and notifications.
* **File Storage:** Secure file upload/download via AWS S3 Presigned URLs.
